# android
I created this repository so that I could document the best options for rooting non-stock Android, and then promptly switched to Google Pixel phones so I didn't have to root my phones to get a vanilla Android experience. This year my spouse has a lower end phone and can use a new ROM to streamline performance so I did my research and updated the repository.
